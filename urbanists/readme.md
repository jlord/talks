These are the slides (pdf in file above) for the ignite I gave on the last day of the 2012 Code for America fellowship: Stop Quoting Jane Jacobs. The slides may be confusing out of context so I've explained them below. The list is by no means comprehensive, but these are the folks that have written or said things that have stuck with me for a while and who I could squeeze into 5 minutes of talking.

## James Howard Kuntsler
- Curses quite a bit but hits the nail on the head.
- "Places not worth remembering."
- from [Geography of Nowhere](http://www.amazon.com/The-Geography-Nowhere-Americas-Landscape/dp/0671888250/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1358209844&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=geography+of+nowhere)

## Andres Duany, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk
- Urbanist couple responsible for some creepy enclaves in Florida but have never the less been fighting the good fight.
- "Trying to cure traffic congestion by adding more capacity is like trying to cure obesity by loosening your belt."
- from [Suburban Nation](http://www.amazon.com/Suburban-Nation-Decline-American-ebook/dp/B0058U7I16/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1358209789&sr=8-1&keywords=suburban+nation)

## Kevin Lynch
- MIT scholar, perhaps my favorite 'science of cities' geek for all work he's done in exploring patterns in human settlements.
- "The good settlement, is relevant and responsive to any human context, and which connects general values to specific actions."
- from [Good City Form](http://www.amazon.com/Good-City-Form-Kevin-Lynch/dp/0262620464/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1358209874&sr=1-1&keywords=good+city+form). [The Image of the City](http://www.amazon.com/Image-Harvard-MIT-Center-Studies-Series/dp/0262620014/ref=pd_sim_b_1) is a good one, too.

## Enrique Pe√±alosa
- Former Mayor of Bogota, Colombia. Did amazing thigns for urban equaility. Champion for people. 
- "A bikeway is a symbol that shows that a citizen on a $30 bicycle is equally important as a citizen in a $30,000 car."
- from a talk he gave

## Jan Gehl
- Perhaps most well known living, active urban designer.
- "Cities for people."
- from [Cities for People](http://www.amazon.com/Cities-People-Jan-Gehl/dp/159726573X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1358210074&sr=1-1&keywords=jan+gehl)

## Michael Dobbins
- Professor of mine at Georgia Tech, responsible for making me the most inspired. Has lots of public sector urban design under his belt. He encouraged us to understand the city elements as they relate to people. 
- "All trips begin and end with walking."
- quote is from a lecture he gave when I was in school, but he has a book, [Urban Design and People](http://www.amazon.com/Urban-Design-People-Michael-Dobbins/dp/0470138165/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1358210175&sr=1-1&keywords=michael+dobbins)
